# SquareGame
Small web languages test. Runs ontop of Node.JS with a bootstrap & canvas frontend (although, Bootstrap isnt really being
used heavily here..) Socket.IO powers the networking between the server and clients.
Game's main index page explains the games rules and what you can do.

# How to use
Run node on the server.js in root. Listens on 8080, so point your browser there.
The IP that the clients connect to is hard coded to localhost:8080 at the moment, 
i am working on a configurable IP setting on the main page.
